Loss Functions:

Loss functions play an important role in any statistical model - they define an objective which the performance of the model is evaluated against and the parameters learned by the model are determined by minimizing a chosen loss function.
Loss functions define what a good prediction is and isn’t. In short, choosing the right loss function dictates how well your estimator will be. This article will probe into loss functions, the role they play in validating predictions, and the various loss functions used.

Broadly, loss functions can be classified into two major categories depending upon the type of learning task we are dealing with — Regression losses and Classification losses. In classification, we are trying to predict output from set of finite categorical values i.e Given large data set of images of hand written digits, categorizing them into one of 0–9 digits. Regression, on the other hand, deals with predicting a continuous value for example given floor area, number of rooms, size of rooms, predict the price of room.
